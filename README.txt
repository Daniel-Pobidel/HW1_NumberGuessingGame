Daniel Pobidel CS407 Mobile App Development- Hw1- Number guessing game

This app asks user to input a number between 1 and 100, and then press button to confirm their answer. Hint will be given in response to
guess,whether it is too low, too high, or way too high(over 100). Upon successful guess, user will be given option to play again. Game
keeps track of current attempts, as well as stats for previous games (total attempts, total wins, average attempts), which can be reset
by entering "444". If a game has been won, the button must be pressed twice to reset stats(first reset game, then reset all). If button
is pressed with no input, nothing happens.

App tested in andriod emulator using Pixel 3 API 27, Andriod 8.1.
